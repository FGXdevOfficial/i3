# My i3 wm workflow

  To install the dependencies run the dependencies.sh script by doing:
  ``chmod +x dependencies.sh``
  ``sh dependencies.sh``
  
  Note that you don't have Polybar and i3-gaps

  To install just run the install.sh script by doing:
  ``chmod +x install.sh``
  ``sh install.sh``

# What is here?
  Well the following:
  - i3-gaps config
  - Polybar config
  - Dependencies installer
  - Install script

# Contribute?

  ignored.

# Forking?
